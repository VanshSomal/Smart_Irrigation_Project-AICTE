# Smart_Irrigation_Project-AICTE
KrishiMind is an AI-powered Smart Irrigation System built during AICTE Virtual Internship (Cycle 2). The basic ML model structure and initial Streamlit setup were taught in training. I enhanced the UI, added visualizations, weather input, water usage insights, and sprinkler ON/OFF prediction.
